# 👋 Hi, I’m Rounit Agrawal

I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Python Developer with 2+ years of experience building real-world, impactful AI systems. I’ve worked extensively at IIT Madras on projects combining deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision — with a strong focus on accessibility, multilingual interfaces, and real-time intelligence.

- 🔭 Currently working on multilingual voice-enabled systems and LLM-based query assistants
- 🌱 Learning more about MLOps, model deployment, and optimization
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on open-source AI tools for healthcare and accessibility
- ⚡ Fun fact: I helped develop a sign-language-controlled wheelchair!
